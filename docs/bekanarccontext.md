BeKan Architecture + Credence — Web Brief for Cascade (Context + Goals)
About BeKan Architecture
BeKan Architecture is a company that uses data to create systems and solve hard problems.

The mission of BeKan is to make the world of business — especially global business — more trustworthy and easier to navigate.

We believe that:

Trust is the foundation of opportunity

Today, business trust is manual, fragmented, and often invisible

Data and AI can help change this, making trust verifiable and shareable

BeKan is a company-builder / product studio — Credence is our first flagship product.

About Credence — Current State
Credence is a platform designed to help businesses verify and demonstrate trustworthiness.

Today it works like this:

For Buyers / Partners:
✅ Search for a business and view its public profile
✅ See key trust signals:

Business Identification Number (BIN)

Basic profile data

Business summary

Trust score (AI-assisted)

Reviews from other businesses

Public metrics and badges

Verified documents

✅ Upload business documents (PDFs, registrations, compliance) → AI gives:

Document summary

Key risk highlights

Verified indicators

✅ Understand if a business is safe to work with → supports procurement, partnerships, due diligence.

For Businesses:
✅ Claim your own Credence profile
✅ Upload verified documents
✅ Build your public trust score
✅ Collect reviews from verified business partners
✅ Show your trust signals to attract new partners
✅ Manage connections on the platform

Our Stage:
MVP is built and functional

We are in early access with trusted first users

We do not claim to have a full global network — we are building toward that

The key is to build real utility today, and trust for the long term

Future Vision
Credence will become:

A universal trust layer for business

A global verified network of businesses — searchable and transparent

A portable, verifiable trust profile that companies can share across platforms

A key part of risk management, procurement, and business relationship-building

But today we are focused on making each part valuable for real users, starting simple.
